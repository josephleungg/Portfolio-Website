                <p className="text-justify text-lg">I'm currently a third year <span className="font-bold text-tertiary">Computer Science </span> 
                    student attending Toronto Metropolitan University! Beyond the screen, I find joy in lifting weights and 
                    going on late night drives, I also love to binge shows and play video games whenever I have the time. 
                    My interests extend to web design and working on software that tackles meaningful real-world problems. 
                    I am always excited to continue learning, and developing myself in the technological field!</p>
